# üç≤ Hotpot Changelog

Breaking changes are in bold.

## x.x.x

- Added ahead of time compilation via `hotpot.api.make`.
- **Improved `x-selection` API selection accuracy.**
  - Now uses `nvim_get_mode` which is sometimes incorrectly reported in keymaps
    set by `whichkey.nvim`, so this is potentially breaking. `vim.keymap.set`
    seems to behave correctly.
- **Moved `fnl`, `fnlfile`, `fnldo`, `eval-operator` and `eval-operator-bang`
  to `hotpot.api.command`.**
